# Open Weather Project
---
### An open source hardware and software solution for a 3D printable weather station including software for analyzing recorded data.
### This project is meant to be a modular solution that incorporates sensors, controls, software, and 3D printed parts.

TODO
 * Establish a basic primary module system that includes hardware, software, and firmware that is used as a base for building on.
 * Create a database of information on materials suitable for use in 3D printing the outdoor sensor parts.
 * Create modules that can be built on to the base controller that add functionality useful for sensing weather.
 * Establish a standard for all hardware, software, communication protocols, and design practices. 
 * Prototype and proof of concept for base controller and a few simple modules.

This is a work in progress, expect a lot to change. this is also not a priority project and may take some time between commits.
I expect to have a functional prototype and software to prove the concept and demonstrate its use before the end of 2018. 
A lot of the development will depend on others and how my schedule goes with other paid work.
